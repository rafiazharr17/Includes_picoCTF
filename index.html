    <h1>On Includes</h1>
    <p>
      Many programming languages and various types of computer files have a
      command, often called include (sometimes copy or import), that causes the
      contents of another file to be inserted into the original file. These
      included files are known as copybooks or header files. They are often used
      to define the physical layout of program data, sections of procedural
      code, and/or initial declarations, while supporting encapsulation and code
      reuse.
